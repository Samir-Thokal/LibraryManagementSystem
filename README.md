The Library Management System is a simple web application designed to facilitate the management of books in a library. It allows users to add, search, borrow, return, and remove books, providing a user-friendly interface for tracking available and borrowed books. The application is built using React and Vite, utilizing a component-based architecture and local state management. The development follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, ensuring that all features are thoroughly tested before implementation.
